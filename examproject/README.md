# Exam project

Our project is titled **Exam project**. We solve the three problems which look at optimal taxation with government consumption, labor adjustment costs and global optimizer with refined multi-start. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Exam-2023-notebook.ipynb](Exam-2023-notebook.ipynb). For each of the three problems there is a matching .py-file such:
- Problem 1: [Problem1.py](Problem1.py)
- Problem 2: [Problem2.py](Problem2.py)
- Problem 3: [Problem3.py](Problem3.py) 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
